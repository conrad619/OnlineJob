        <p>In the past seven years of leading B2B campaigns, I have had the opportunity to work very closely with enterprise clients and tech teams on developing campaign strategies, content, landing pages, banners, and eDMs with lead generation as the key objective. With the right strategy and assets, generating tonnes of traffic can be easily achieved, but converting traffic into qualified leads—then into opportunities and sales—remains a challenge for most B2B marketers. Here are some reasons:</p>
        <section>

          <h2>Dead or wrong links from traffic drivers to landing page</h2>
          <p>An eDM is the most important and most commonly used source of traffic driver in any B2B campaign. It may seem like a no-brainer but it is imperative to check every single link on the campaign’s assets before going live. One of the worst nightmares of any marketer is an eDM that has been blasted out to thousands of prospects with a dead or wrong link leading to the wrong landing page.</p>

          <h2>Poor user experience</h2>
          <p>Having the right user experience can make or break your lead generation efforts. The journey from the landing page to the call-to-action (CTA) should be so meticulously designed and well thought out that the prospect has a clear path to clicking the CTA button. This means no unnecessary distractions such as secondary CTAs—it is key to focus on the offer and simplify the conversion process.</p>
          <p>Some poorly optimised sites can take too long to load, resulting in users dropping off before even reaching the site. The opportunity cost can be immense.</p>
          <p>Making prospects in your database fill up forms in every inbound lead-nurturing email marketing campaign might make sense to the marketer for the purpose of updating the database, but this process can irritate the prospect, especially if he or she has filled up the same form before.</p>
